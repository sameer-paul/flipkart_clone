*   Seller Info Completion & Update Flow

1.  Initial Completion:

    - When a seller first provides their details, the system checks if any field is missing.
    - If all required fields are filled, the profile is marked as complete.

2.  Dashboard Behavior:

    - Once the profile is completed for the first time, the "Seller Info" section will no longer appear in the dashboard.
    - Sellers will need to access their profile settings to view or update their information.

3.  Update & Security:

    - If a seller wants to update their profile later, they must first verify their identity via OTP authentication.
    - Only after successful OTP verification will they be able to see and edit their details.
    - This ensures a secure and structured approach to managing seller profiles while improving user experience and data integrity.
